### About:
- Calculators are a great help: everyone is familiar with them. Why not write one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, multiplies, but also is smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

### Result:
- Apart from writing quite a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. You will also get a closer experience with 2 important data structures: stack and queue.
