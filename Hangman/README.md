### About:
- Games can help you kill time when you’re bored - and here we don’t mean smartphone games, but the classic paper-and-pencil ones. However, we aren’t inviting you to kill time: on the contrary, we offer to write a game and improve your programming skills. In this project, you will work on the Hangman, a game where the player is supposed to guess a word letter by letter. Make a program that plays Hangman with you - and good luck with the guessing!

### Result:
- Best project for Python Basics: functions, loops, lists and other variables. And Random module as a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages, they ensure that your dive in Python is smooth and safe.
